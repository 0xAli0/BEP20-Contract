# BEP20Token Contract

The BEP20Token contract is a basic implementation of the BEP-20 token standard on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC). It allows you to create and manage your own fungible tokens on the BSC ecosystem.

## Features

- Name: BEP20Token
- Symbol: [YourTokenSymbol]
- Decimals: [YourTokenDecimals]
- Total Supply: [YourTotalSupply]

## Getting Started

1. Customize the token name, symbol, decimals, and initial supply in the constructor.
2. Deploy the contract on the Binance Smart Chain testnet or mainnet.
3. Interact with the contract using the provided functions (transfer, approve, transferFrom).

## Contract Deployment

- `name`: The name of your token (e.g., "My Token")
- `symbol`: The symbol of your token (e.g., "MTK")
- `decimals`: The number of decimals to represent your token (e.g., 18)
- `initialSupply`: The initial supply of tokens to be minted (e.g., 1000000)
